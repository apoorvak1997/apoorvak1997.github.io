                      <p class="mb-30">Moving from one place to another allows you to experience many new aspects of life,
                         however, moving from one country to another is a life changing experience. Many people immigrate
                          to have a better living, yet some move to explore new opportunities. I could relate to all of 
                          those people who moved to a new country to explore more about themselves and to explore more 
                          opportunities as well. I, along with my family, moved to United States few years ago. 
                          it was not easy for us to leave everything behind and head towards a fresh new start. 
                          It was hard to leave the place where I spent my childhood and leave my friends was not something that I 
                          was willing to give away, but, In the end, God had better plans for me. Every immigrant has different 
                          experiences and when they move to a new country. For instance, different curriculum and language 
                          barrier are the most important one that I encountered.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">I think the biggest change for me is that with this move I am leaving the past behind. Although I began college still living in our current apartment, the apartment and neighborhood hold me back because it is comprised of different versions of myself, from elementary school all the way to the beginning of my collegiate career.
                        I want to reinvent myself and start fresh and change of scenery. Memories both good and bad, remain and linger in the nearby parks and schools I went to that are close by.</p>
                      <blockquote>If you are still looking for that one person who will change your life, take a look in
                        the mirror.</blockquote>
                      <p class="mb-30">At the end, people move from one place to another to explore more opportunities, yet it takes a lot of effort and sacrifices to stand firm and make moves. It was one of the toughest decision for my family and I, yet turn into the best decision of our life. It feels like a home now and we all are on our track to achieve our goals. I am currently in a community college and planning to transfer to a university for better education. I could not have imagined a better living and better education anywhere else in the world than United States and I strongly believe that dreams do come true in this land.</p>
